# NAME OF POLICY

Rhysida XDR Policy

## Use Case

Recently the United States Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center issued a statement on the Rhysida RaaS (Ransomware as a Service) group and the new program called Rhysida-0.1. Following this Vedre Labs (https://www.forescout.com/research-labs/) issued a blog post about both the ransomware and how Forescout's XDR technology can help detect this (https://www.forescout.com/blog/rhysida-ransomware-detecting-a-significant-threat-to-healthcare-and-other-sectors/). This policy takes the Detection Rule in XDR and leverages eyeSight/eyeControl to take an action. 

NOTE: The two actions listed are customizable based on the controls needed.

## Needed for the policy

The following is needed for this policy to work:

- Forescout eyeSight/eyeControl
- Forescout XDR Subscription
- Both products integrated
- The XML file that defines the policy (Rhysida - DR-0085.xml)

NOTE: One of the actions is an integration between ServiceNow and Forescout and is not a requirement.
