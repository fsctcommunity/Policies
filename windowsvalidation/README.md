# Validated Windows Policy

## Use Case

This policy will check to see if a Windows machine has been activated and validated. This policy relies on a script taken from Github (<https://github.com/drkrap/Detect-Windows-Validation>) and there is a Spanish and English version of this script. The script is freely available to be used.

## Needed for the policy

There are several things needed for this policy:

- The .bat file (either English or Spanish) depending on what language you are using

- The XML file
