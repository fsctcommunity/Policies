# NAME OF POLICY

REM Example Policy

## Use Case

The Cloud Data Exchange module populates are large number of attributes in eyeSight/eyeControl allowing one to create policies based on items discovered in REM. One of those attributes is "Internet Exposure" which is what this policy leverages.

Once something is detected in REM, there is a timer in the Cloud Data Exchange to pull that information into eyeSight/Control which by default is 15 minutes. If the attribute is created, then the full scope of the platform is available from a management point of view. This is an example policiy.

## Things needed

The folowing things are needed for this policy to work:
- Active subscription to Forescout Risk and Exposure Management
- Updated Cloud Data Exchange module running on eyeSight/eyeControl
- REM -- Internet Exposure.xml
